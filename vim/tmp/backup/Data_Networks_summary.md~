## Chapter 1: roadmap

### internet
= hundreds of millions of connected computing devices (hosts = end systems)

- Internet Service Provider:
    + interconnected isps (network of networks)
    + tier3 local, tier2 national, tier1 global
- _protocols_, control sending, receiving of msgs
    + tcp, ip http, smtp
- _Internet standarts_
    + IETF: internert engineering task force
    + IETF publishes RFCs (requests for comments) describing/defining protocols
- Infrastructure that provides services to apps
    + Web, voip, email ...
    + distributed applications
- end systems provides applic programming interface 
    + rules for exchanging data between progs
    + provides service options,analogous to postal service

#### network protocols
- communication between machines 
- communication activity in the internet governed by protocols

_protocols_ define _format_, _order_ of _messages sent and received_ among network entities, and _actions taken_
on message transmission or receipt

### network edge
- hosts: client and servers
- _access networks_: physical connection of end system to first router (edge router)
    + residential access nets
    + mobile access networks
    + lan
- _network core_ 
    + interconnected routers
    + network of networks
- access net:
    + dsl
        * different frequencies for telephone and internet data
        * dslam translate in digital
        * rates are limited by isp or distance to CO
    + cable
        * residence: needs cable modem ti exchange data with cable modem termination system (cmts)
        * optical fibre or coxial cable
        * network of cable attaches home to isp router
        * homes _share access networks_ to cable headend unlike dsl, which has dedicated access
- wireless access networks connects endsystem to router
    + via access point uses radio signals shared by several end systems

#### physical media
- _bit_ : send by propagating electomagnetic waves or optical pulses
- _physical link_ : lies between transmitter, receiver
        + guided media : propagate in solid media
        + unguided media: propagate freely e.g. radio waves
- coaxial cable 
- fiber optic cable
    + much faster, lower error rate but expensive
    + used for long distance link, e.g. oversea

### network core
- mesh of interconnected routers
- *what do routers do?*
- *packet switching:*
    + hosts run network apps and break application -layer messages into packets
    + forward packets from one router to the next, from source to destination
    + packetes may be buffered and queue while passing network nodes
    + *store and forward:* entire package must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
    + end-end delay
    + queuing and loss:
        * routers have one buffer per outgoing link=> store packets that the router is about to send into the link
        * if arriver rote (in bits) to link exceeds transmission rate of link for a period of time
            1. packetes will queue, wait to be transmitted on link
            2. packetets can be dropped if memory fills up
    + key functions:
        * *routing* : determines source destination route taken by packets (routing algorithms)
        * *forwarding* : move packets frome router's input to appropriate router output
-packet switching vs circuit switching
    + packet switching = no guarentees, just go there without reservation
    + circuit switching 
        * network ressources are reserverd
        * links are separated into circuit segments
        * fraction of each links
        * transmission capacity is reserved for duration of the connection
        * frequency division multiplexing or time -division multiplexing

####hosts sending function
- takes application message
- breaks into smaller chunks /packets of length L (packetization)bps
- transmitts packet into access network  at transmission rate R (bits/s)
- link transmission rate= link bandwidth
- packet transmission delay =$ L/R bits/(bits/s)$

#### Internet stuctiore
- *tier-1 commercial isps* : national & international coverage, providers of internet backbone (backbone is the core of the internet
- *content provider network* (e.g. google): private network that connects it data centers to internet, often bypassing tier-1, regionals isps

### loss and delay
- packets queue in routers buffers
    + packet arrival rate to link exceeds output link transmission rate
    + packets queue, wait for turn


#### four sources of packet delay
- dnodal= dproc+ dqueue + dtrans + dprop
- dproc: nodal processing
    + examine header of packet
    + check for bit-level errors
    + determine output link
    + typically < 1/100 millisec (ms)
- dqueue: queueing delay
    + time waiting at output link for transmission
    + depends on congetion level of router
    + 1/1000 -1ms
- dtrans: transmissiondelay
    + L: packet length (bits)
    + R: link bandwidth (bps)
    + dtrans : L/R
- dprop: propagation delay
    + d:length of physical link
    + s: propagation speed in medium $(~2x10^8 m/s)$
    + dprop = d/s
    + in wide area networks: order of milliseconds  otherwise negligible

#### End to end delay
- total delay from source to destination
- N-1 routers on the path between src and dest
- no queueing 
- assume dproc is processing delay at each router (+ src router)
- transmission rate out of eauch router and out of src host is R => dtrans = L/R
- propagationdelay dprop of each link
- endto end delay: dend-to-end= N(dproc+dtrans+dprop)

####Queueing delay
- R
- L
- a average packet arrival rate (packets/s)
- lamda=a x L is arrival rate (bits/s)
- lamda/R ~0 avg queueing delay small
- lamda/R =1 avg queueing delay large
- lamda/R >1 average delay infinite! more work arriving than can be serviced
